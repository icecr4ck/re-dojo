Welcome to our reverse engineering dojo!

Here you will find different articles about reverse engineering, binary analysis and logical programming.

Blog posts are either written in french or english depending on our mood.

A first article is coming soon, a write-up about a diamond-related programming language using virtualization obfuscation (this one will be in french).

Enjoy the read!
